Data processing steps:

1. The map on page 2 of the report shows cities with inclusive energy efficiency and renewable energy policies/programs, by type of policy/program. The goal was to convert this into an interactive map using datawrapper. The first step was to make a CSV file and manually pull out the information from the map (with columns for city and type of policy).

2. Uploaded this CSV into datawrapper to pull in lat/lon coordinates for each city. 

3. Mapped the data using datawrapper

4. Downloaded the data in CSV format to include columns for lat and lon.
