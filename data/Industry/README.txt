Data processing steps:

1. Obtained industry data: The table in the BLS data (linked above) provides data on occupations by sex and race/ethnicity.  The goal was to create four graphs from here:
	i. Figure of all occupations by sex
	ii. Figure of all occupations by race/ethnicity
	iii. Figure of climate occupations by sex
	iv. Figure of climate occupations by race/ethnicity. 
Data for figures (i) and (iii) are easily readable in the BLS link and are just the first rows in each occupation section.

2. Link to climate jobs: To define climate jobs, I used page 15 of this Brookings Report (https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2019.04_metro_Clean-Energy-Jobs_Report_Muro-Tomer-Shivaran-Kane_updated.pdf). I then manually took the climate jobs by race or sex from the BLS data. 

3. Create the 4 interactive figures using datawrapper:

	(i). Pasted relevatn data into data wrapper 
	(ii). Created graph and picked colours with team. 
	(iii). Added notes.
