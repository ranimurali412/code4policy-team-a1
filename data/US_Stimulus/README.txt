Data processing steps:

1. The table on page 5 of the Sierra Club pdf has the summary forecasted jobs numbers calculated by this organisation. Copied these numbers and industries to a spreadsheet to manipulate this data

2. Matched industries provided by Sierra Club with BLS industries (see industry data folder) to calculate race & ethnicity, and sex summaries of these industries

3. Uploaded two sets of data for men/women and for race & ethinicity via CSV into datawrapper

4. Created one table and one chart using datawrapper
	(i) made colors consistent with other pages
	(ii) added notes about the data
